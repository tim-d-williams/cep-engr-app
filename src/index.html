        It has been several years since I had a chance to dabble in website coding. Having worked for smaller companies in the past, there were always opportunities to work on a variety of projects that exposed me to HTML, CSS, XML/XSL. Through research online and reading books (those were the thing at that time) I was able to learn enough to help a few friends with their websites. I have always had interest in furthering this knowledge and the CEP seems like a great opportunity.
